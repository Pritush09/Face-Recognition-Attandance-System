# Project Name: Face-Recognition Attendance System with Anti-Spoof
### Description
This project aims to develop a robust face recognition attendance system with anti-spoofing capabilities to prevent fraudulent attempts at marking attendance. It utilizes state-of-the-art facial recognition algorithms along with anti-spoofing techniques to ensure the system accurately identifies and verifies the faces of individuals and prevents spoofing attacks.

### Features
* Face detection and recognition for accurate identification.
* Anti-spoofing measures to prevent fraudulent attempts.
* Real-time attendance tracking and recording.
* User-friendly interface for easy setup and management.
* Scalable architecture to accommodate a growing number of users.

### Installation
Clone the repository from GitHub.

`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git`

Install the required dependencies.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run the application.

`python main.py`

### Usage
Ensure that the camera is properly connected and configured.
Run the application and follow the on-screen instructions for setup.
Enroll users by capturing their faces for the first time.
Use the system for attendance tracking and management.
Monitor the anti-spoofing measures to ensure the system's security.
