Project Name: Face-Recognition Attendance System with Anti-Spoof
Description
This project aims to develop a robust face recognition attendance system with anti-spoofing capabilities to prevent fraudulent attempts at marking attendance. It utilizes state-of-the-art facial recognition algorithms along with anti-spoofing techniques to ensure the system accurately identifies and verifies the faces of individuals and prevents spoofing attacks.

Features
Face detection and recognition for accurate identification.
Anti-spoofing measures to prevent fraudulent attempts.
Real-time attendance tracking and recording.
User-friendly interface for easy setup and management.
Scalable architecture to accommodate a growing number of users.
